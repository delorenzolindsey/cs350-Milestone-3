module5 milestone 3 of CS 350


## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project is from Module 5 of CS350 from SNHU. This project incorporates a Raspberry Pi, solderless breadboard, Wires, 1 button, 2 LED lights, and a 16x2 LCD screen. This system reads a message, converts it into morse code, displays the morse code onto the LED Lights, displays the text of the message onto the LCD 16x2 screen, and allows the user to switch message through a button press.

## What did you do particularly well? Where could you improve?

I `troubleshot the wires` well. I removed all wires and began from the beginning to ensure my error was not due to misplacement of hardware. I could improve with `patience`. At first, I did not think my system was working. When I pressed the button the switching message was delayed a few seconds. It was simply finishing one message before resuming the next.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The tools that really help this system work is `the button`. The light and LCD screen are very big contributors for this assignment; however, the button adds an element of user interaction. It must not only function, but it must listen for the user action, so as to not interfere with the main function.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The `user interaction` aspect of the assignment is really interesting. I love learning more about computer science, however, the user interaction helps me imagine creating functioning products for a future company.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

`Clear Communication within commits` helps all future developers reading my code. If communication is clear then the purpose of the functions are straight forward and future errors will be easily spotted. Errors are crucial to spot in future project expansions.
